# SRI Test Project Code Changelog

## 2026-02-11
- Updated `sri_int_test_plan_generator.py` to produce four report sections
  (strategy, Day Zero, Day 1, Day 2) with detailed test cases and steps.
- Added per-section diagram focus with a hand-drawn CSS effect for report
  headers and included author/date metadata.
- Skipped AI usage reporting refactor because no reporting code exists in the
  module at this time.
- Removed performance and concurrency-focused test cases from the Day 2
  integration section.
- Enhanced the Day Zero/Day 1/Day 2 section diagrams with a stronger
  hand-drawn visual treatment.
- Added stronger section demarcation and increased diagram focus for
  Day Zero/Day 1/Day 2 sections via CSS and focus parameters.
- Strengthened section borders and overlaid section titles on diagrams.
- Increased hand-drawn styling and focus zoom for the Day Zero/Day 1/Day 2
  section images.
- Restored the High-Level section title by rendering an `<h2>` heading when
  the overlay title is not used.
